		"etc" : "CERTAIN FAQS 1. What format can we shoot on? You can shoot on any format. Handicam, HD camera, phone, super 8, digital SLR or digitising each  frame by scanning it in - we dont mind. However, you should aim to make the most of whatever you are  shooting on by lighting your scene well, framing the shot carefully and recording clear sound. Source  equipment via teachers, friends and family, and be inventive.     2. But I have created an awesome 17 minute masterpiece - pleeeeease can I enter it? Short answer - no, sorry. The time limits are there to make sure the pre-judging team has time to watch  and consider all 70+ submitted films with sufficient attention to detail, which can already take some time.  First approach - try and edit down your film, taking out all extraneous material. If its still too long but very  good, consider submitting it to another festival or competition.  3. What makes a winning film? Primarily we will be looking for an original and creative take on a chosen theme that engages an audience  successfully. We will also be looking to see a structure that supports the idea, in other words, form  should match the content. A golden rule is that all good stories have a beginning, middle and end, though not always told in  that order. (For example, you may want to start with the end and tell the story in flashback). Even  experimental films should have a structure - for example, the rhythmic repetition of a visual motif, that  might change and weave into other directions and then work its way round to remind us of the beginning  again. It is about a sense of unity and wholeness to the piece, as though it has been conceived as a  complete idea from start to finish, not an incomplete fragment that is not resolved. We will also be looking at the technical aspects of the film. Not whether you have used the latest editing  software, camera, or smart computer special effects, but fundamentals of good visual storytelling like  focus, framing, control of light, creative use of location or sets, wardrobe/costume, sound recording and  editing to tell the story and/or create the mood and feeling. Also, a consideration for drama is the performance of the actors. It is therefore of some importance that  you cast your actors carefully and that they can deliver an acceptable performance to convey the story.  Most schools have drama teachers and students interested in acting. Make the most of the skills these  people have to offer. Likewise with documentary - your subjects need to have some degree of screen  presence or something that holds the interest of the audience."
